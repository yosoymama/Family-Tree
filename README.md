# Family-Tree
I would like to find some partners to create a “Family Tree” blockchain.  A single place families can go to create their own blockchains to securely store wills, prenuptial agreements, house deeds, and all valuable digital assets (or tokenized physical assets).  I would also like this project to have the ability to, redistribute the assets to the designated family members in the blockchain, in the event of a death.  I can see blockchain being the future of how generations pass down their wealth, important documents, and select family photos in the near future.  My technical understanding of protocols and coding is very limited to none.  However, I have many ideas of how a family tree blockchain could be practically used.  How can I find somebody with the technical abilities to help me execute the creation of this service on Filecoin?
